# Computational-Chemistry-Research-Project
Final year undergraduate university research project in computational chemistry searching for novel organic molecules that will display room temperature phosphorescence to be used in photoluminescence applications.

This python files contain the data analysis code used for this project, a ~6,900 word dissertation, the abstract of the project is as follows: 

Organic materials pose an environmentally friendly, low cost and low toxicity option for photoluminescence applications; however, room temperature phosphorescence, (RTP), is rare in organic materials in solution. This paper explores the various phenomena that enhance a molecules photoluminescent properties, for example thermally activated delayed fluorescence, (TADF) along with the characteristics that are suggestive of photoluminescence in a molecule, such as the energy of the first excited triplet state, E(T1). A database consisting of 48,182 organic semiconductors has been analysed using computational methods and suggestions for molecules to be investigated further will be made in this thesis. The heterofission mechanism was considered for each molecule where carbazole, (Cz), was the host in the system and the molecules being tested were potential guests. A total of 214 Cz derivatives were found in the database, the geometries of which were optimised at the T1 minima to increase the accuracy of the heterofission mechanism rule. Suggestions were then made based on this mechanism, providing valuable suggestions for the guest in a Cz host-guest system that can be synthesised for potential photoluminescence applications.

The database was sourced from the University of Liverpool and can be found at the following link in the file 'CSD_EES_DB.csv': https://datacat.liverpool.ac.uk/1472/
